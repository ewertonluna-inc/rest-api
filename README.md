# REST API
## Project Overview
This project consists of a REST API using the Express Framework. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database information about courses: users can interact with the relational database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

It's build using REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence.
